# Making Changes
- update rofi for dmenu-search to use ctrl+enter to open brave in tab mode
    - update this script to be more effective/automated for opening windows
    - I want this script to be super easy to make changes to (ie add icons for newe bookmarks, update bookmarks, change browsers etc.)
